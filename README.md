# Personalized-AI-Career-Coach
Personalized AI Career Coach ingests a candidate’s profile (skills, experience, education, assessments, engagement data) and predicts a Career Success Score (0–100) and supporting signals. The coach can then generate personalized recommendations: top skills to learn, resume highlights, role-fit suggestions, and interview prep plans.
